# Workshop 3: Multisensor Navigation
The aim of this workshop is to produce an integrated navigation solution from a 
combination of different technologies. Work inclusing working with odometry, magnetic 
compass, inertial navigation and GNSS, applying Kalman filtering to integrating data from 
different sensors.
